- Use the DC features to create a Signal (0 or 1)
	--> Can be improve with more work but we do not have time now

- We use the correlation to find the asset that are in the same "mood". A PCA can be a good method to do it also but maybe with more asset.


**Today's Notes on Target Prediction: Related to the Market Regime Alpha on the FW major currencies**

**1.** Our current model yields strong results for the designated target.

**2.** However, several issues have been identified:

- The target might not be optimal. For instance, if a Directional Change (DC) begins tomorrow during a bullish trend, the present target doesn't cater to such scenarios.
- The target definition requires revisiting, but we're constrained by time.
- Potential overfitting problems associated with the model.

**3.** Recommendations moving forward:

- Despite the challenges, the signal appears predictable. It's worthwhile to refine the target and monitor if the high accuracy is maintained.
- Explore other currencies. Particularly, consider asset bagging with additional currencies, like USDCAD, to enhance the strategy's robustness.
