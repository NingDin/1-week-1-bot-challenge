- Here, we need to keep in mind that we will work on a target that predict the return from now to 400h later. So, all the short term variables will just had noise in our model.

- We will keep our "method", take 3 assets that are similar (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY) to create the model.

- To test the model, we need to look about a regression metric. We will take the mean absolute error. But, even with the best MAE or MSE, it doesn't mean anything for us. So, we will check how many times they vary in the same time (60% is really good but the dataset is very small)
