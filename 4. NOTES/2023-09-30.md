- We need to be aware that, when we use the double frontier labeling, we choose a position way. I mean, when you create the target, you know that you will take only buy or sell positions with the model
- When you use a classification, you have true/false negative/positive values. For example if you are prediction natural disaster, the worst thing is a false negative (we said negative but it was positive). Obviously in finance and trading, it is bad because we missed an opportunity. 
- But, the worst thing for us are the false positive, we thing that it was a winning position, we invested capital and finally it wasn't. That's why the accuracy doesn't mean a lot of thing for us.
