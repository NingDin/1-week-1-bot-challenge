- No good results for the strategy that combine different horizon with the FX currencies
- I worked on a signal similar to the short term variation predictor with the double barrrier but this time for the Ethereum only. It increase the odds of overfitting but reduce the time to find something interesting. So, IT WILL BE MANDATORY TO USE THE ROBUSTNESS TESTS TEMPLATE of the Alpha Quant program for this straetgy.
- We have a precision of 45% for a R of 1.5, so it is really good.
